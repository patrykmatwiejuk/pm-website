            <span class="semibold">Hello!</span>
            <br><br>
    
    
            I'm <span class="semibold">Patryk Matwiejuk.</span>
            <br><br>
            I want to be the very best, like no one ever was.
            <br>            
            No, I'm just kidding... well, not really. Let's get to the point.
            <br>        
            I have started learning web development in 2016, 
            <br> 
            and I discovered the deep oceans of HTML and CSS.
            <br><br>
            Then I met JavaScript...           
            <br><br>
            ...and left it all for 3 months.             
            <br><br>
            Beginnings are tough, huh? Yes, they are, so am I.
            <br>
            I felt the need of writing code, HTML, CSS, JS, doesn't matter.
            <br>
            I've started to tell my friends I want to make websites,
            <br>
            that I want to become a frontend web developer, you know?
            <br>
            I made this and this. My first two websites! Woohoo!
            <br>
            And the first one is even running on top of Wordpress!
            <br><br>
            Then I started to struggle with learning new things.
            <br>
            I needed some kind of impulse so I started looking 
            <br>
            for bootcamps on the internet and I found a <span class="semibold">software testing</span>
            one. 
            <br>
            I was like, "what's that? Is this even a real thing worth looking into?"
            <br>
            Then I've started to read about software testing and I became
            <br>
            very interested in this topic.</p>
    
                <span class="readmore"><a href="#wtsection" class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"> </a></span>
    </div>

    <div class="wtbox" id="wtsection">
        <p> I was always a <span class="regular">perfectionist</span> kind of person.
            <br><br>
            I have stopped being a complete  perfectionist, 
            <br>
            because it kills productivity,
            but I kept the care for the quality of things with me.
            <br>
            I could always spot bugs, minor and major errors in the UI or UX part
            <br>
            of an application, and I usually kept the fix suggestions for myself.
            <br>
            Not anymore! When I took a software testing course in the Coders Lab IT School,
            <br>
            it changed my point of view on things.
            I had a clear look on what I had yet to learn. 
            <br>
            In the first three days we learned
            about testing methodologies 
            <br>
            and everything included in the ISTQB syllabus.
            <br>
            I really liked that part because I learned a lot about the principles of testing.
            <br>
            We also had the opportunity to create our first user stories, test plans,
            <br> 
            test cases and bug reports. I absolutely loved the SQL workshop part,
            <br>
            because I really like working with it.
            <br><br>
            On 18th of August 2019 I had the ISTQB FL exam which I passed. 
            <br>
            It was hard even after reading the syllabus three times, but now I am a happy 
            holder of the ISTQB FL certificate. 
            <br><br>
            Now <span class="semibold">I'm looking for work in software testing.</span>
            <br><br>
            Am I qualified enough to join your <span class="semibold">QA</span>
            team as a <span class="semibold">Junior Software Tester</span>?
            <br><br>
